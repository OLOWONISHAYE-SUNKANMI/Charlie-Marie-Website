            <p className='text-left text-[16px] my-5'>Charlie Marie story is indeed a unique one. The main occurring theme throughout our Charlie Marie 10-year journey is - DIVINE INSTRUCTION</p>
            <p className='text-left text-[16px] my-5'>When in 2010, I purchased the land at remote Labori Oloja, right in what many call "the bush" I had no idea that it would end up as a school. 
                I was a resident in England but knew I would retire back home, for home is best. All I wanted was to have a mini estate and build houses to rent out and have an assured income to live on in my old age. That was simple and achievable. But unknown to me, God had other plans, which, well, was a harder option.</p>
            <p className='text-left text-[16px] my-5'>In 2012, after being saved from an early grave when a major surgery I had almost claimed my life, God threw at me, while on a wheelchair so many soul-searching questions. What if you didn't survive? What legacy would you have left behind? Have you done all that I created you to do? To be honest, I was convinced then that I was doing my best for the Lord, travelling all over the world to evangelise! I made sure I wasn't just enjoying luxuries but sacrificing to spread the Word. I was well known in the US, Italy, France, Ireland, etc, as a keen and passionate preacher and was was winning souls.</p>
