           <div className='justify-item-start items-left'>
            <p className='text-justify text-[16px] my-5 md:mx-20'>Charlie Marie story is indeed a unique one. The main occurring theme throughout our Charlie Marie 10-year journey is - DIVINE INSTRUCTION</p>
            <p className='text-justify text-[16px] my-5 md:mx-20'>When in 2010, I purchased the land at remote Labori Oloja, right in what many call "the bush" I had no idea that it would end up as a school. 
                I was a resident in England but knew I would retire back home, for home is best. All I wanted was to have a mini estate and build houses to rent out and have an assured income to live on in my old age. That was simple and achievable. But unknown to me, God had other plans, which, well, was a harder option.</p>
            <p className='text-justify text-[16px] my-5 md:mx-20'>In 2012, after being saved from an early grave when a major surgery I had almost claimed my life, God threw at me, while on a wheelchair so many soul-searching questions. What if you didn't survive? What legacy would you have left behind? Have you done all that I created you to do? To be honest, I was convinced then that I was doing my best for the Lord, travelling all over the world to evangelise! I made sure I wasn't just enjoying luxuries but sacrificing to spread the Word. I was well known in the US, Italy, France, Ireland, etc, as a keen and passionate preacher and was was winning souls.</p>
            <p className='text-justify text-[16px] my-5 md:mx-20'>However, God wanted something different from me. He wanted in me, a bit of Florence Nightingale (The Lady with the Lamp), a bit of Mother Teresa (Missionary Nun), and a large part of the Biblical Doreas (Tabitha). These are indeed HUGE responsibilities and a lot fo sacrifices would be be needed! I was not sure that I was ready for such despite my being a philantropist. I was born different. Daughter of a rich man but always had a heart for the poor.
                I was being called upon to shine my light in a remote village in the Sagamu LGA, and I wasn t offered an opportunity to refuse! When God wants you to do something, you must! So before I knew it, I started changing my plans. I had to build a brighter future for our children and leave a good legacy behind. Little did I know then what I was saying yes to!</p>
            <p className='text-justify text-[16px] my-5 md:mx-20'>In 2012, while still in England battling health crisis. I, in obedience to the call from my Lord, changed my mind and decided to build a school and not a mini housing estate. It was not easy. I knew nothing about the localty and, worse still, news reaching me was that the local people were tough! Notwithstanding, I went ahead, and built up part of the land. In January 2014, after a lot of hashes, especially with the 'omoniles'. Charlie Marie opened her doors to the 1st intake. In week 1 of resumption, we had 6 children and six staff members. I was alarmed, for we had prepared 
              extensively. 6 children only? How come? I instructed the staff, and we all went marching around the neighbourhood advertising the school. By the end of the following week, our pupil number rose to 15.
            </p>
             <p className='text-justify text-[16px] my-5 md:mx-20'>Charlie Marie faced so many challenges, some normal and some abnormal. But I had one main focus/vision - I have left my family in the UK and came too the hinterland to build a brighter future for the children as instructed by God. Nothing will stop me from doing this! Also, no sacrifice is too great to raise champions.</p>
              <p className='text-justify text-[16px] my-5 md:mx-20'>It was a tough and rough ride from the onset. I had standards set, and I didn't want to be like
"the others." I wanted to be an agent of change, for we must shine our light bright and clear. I wanted the children to be world class citizens; I wanted to continuously improve the staff so that iron will sharpen iron; I wanted the neighbourhood to be a safe and friendly place for everyone, and I wanted to do everything right. So help me, God! To achieve it all, everyone must work very hard. Unfortunately, not everyone shared our vision, and we had to struggle more.</p>
               <p className='text-justify text-[16px] my-5 md:mx-20'>By 2016, Charlie Marie had grown bigger and our enviable infrastructure was near completion. We became well known in the neighbourhood, and had gotten nursery and primary school government approvals to the glory of God. Charlie Marie continued to maintain a good standard, and we started venturing out. My greatest joy was seeing my children grow and improve daily. We were indeed raising the bar and maintaining our standards. We came ist in the very first external competition we were invited to, in spite of our children being very young. We, however, had a peculiar problem. Although Charlie Marie is a beautiful and safe school with good infrastructure, we were not charging high fees.</p>
                <p className='text-justify text-[16px] my-5 md:mx-20'>What should have worked for us was being used against us. Mischief makers kept telling untruths about us, dissuading parents from bringing their wards to us, saying we were very expensive! It took a lot of rallies and PRs to correct the lies. With God on our side, we, as Charlie Marie family kept overcoming challenges, and moving forward ever, backwards never. Our Children were doing very well within the localty and outside, so much so that people did not believe our children were from LABORI OLOJA. Anytime I look back, I am encouraged. My heart warms, and I want to see more children grow. My Charlie Marie children, I repeat, are worth all my sacrifice.</p>
                 <p className='text-justify text-[16px] my-5 md:mx-20'>Charlie Marie College commenced in September 2018 to the glory of God. Initially, I was not keen on starting the secondary school, but we could not watch our children leave us when there could be continuity. The secondary school was hard work. It was very tough getting approval, but we kept working hard, complying with all directives, and finally got our Secondary School approval, again to the golory of God. Our WAEC approval soon followed. Running a secondary school is tough. It is nothing compared to a primary school. The children were more advanced, many are troublesome as they were in the unique stage of human development called adolescence! Wow, we kept on dealing with one incident or another and became problem solvers. Well all these are part of life and we just have to love all our children. No matter how long it takes, we must keep doing the best for our children and get them the best that life has to offer.</p>
                  <p className='text-justify text-[16px] my-5 md:mx-20'>In 2021, Charlie Marie added our Vocational Section to our group of schools. This comprises of Tailoring and Fashion Design, Information Technology, Electrical Installations, and Home Economics sections.</p>
                   <p className='text-justify text-[16px] my-5 md:mx-20'>So, to wrap it up and bring us to the present, Charlie Marie at 10 can be summarised as 10 years of building a brighter future and still going strong. 10 years of shining our light and brightening all dark corners around us. 10 years of imparting the lives of our young ones, teaching them sound discipline, and ensuring that they too impart the lives of others. Charlie Marie is a beacon of hope, and our hopes will not be dased, so help us God.</p>
                    <p className='text-justify text-[16px] my-5 md:mx-20'>My special appreciation to our dedicated, diligent, and persevering management and staff, who daily sacrifice to support the Charlie Marie vision and mission. They help to provide quality education to indigent children, giving them a voice, a chance, and a future.</p>
                     <p className='text-justify text-[16px] my-5 md:mx-20'>Charlie-Marie story is one of courage, battling to survive attacks and onslaught, only by the help of God Almighty. My special thanks to all our vision supporters, especially all individuals and groups within and outside Nigeria who are sponsoring some of our children.</p>
                      <p className='text-justify text-[16px] my-5 md:mx-20'>Our decade in existence is just a beginning, for we are here to stay.</p>
                      <p className='text-justify text-[16px] my-5 md:mx-20'>As we celebrate this milestone, we honor the past and cherish the present, in full confidence that God will shape or future. We shall together and with combined synergy, continue to build a brighter tomorrow for all children, their families, our local community, and the nation at large.</p>
                      <p className='text-justify text-[16px] my-5 md:mx-20'>We are Charlie Marie, we watch them young to build a brighter future for prosterity. So help me God. Amen </p>
